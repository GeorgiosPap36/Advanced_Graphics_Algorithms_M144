# Advanced Graphics Algorithms

This repository contains the solution to the project for the masterâ€™s course Advanced Graphics Algorithms. The project focuses on expanding the functionality of a basic raytracer, initially designed to handle only spheres, to support ray tracing with arbitrary cuboids. The raytracer outputs a raytraced image, though it is not designed for real-time rendering. The rendered image is displayed using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.

### Key Features

- Extended Raytracer Capabilities: Modified the raytracer to handle arbitrary cuboids in addition to spheres.
- Raytraced Image Output: Generates high-quality images through ray tracing, simulating light interactions with various objects.
- SDL Integration: Utilized SDL to display the final raytraced image output.
